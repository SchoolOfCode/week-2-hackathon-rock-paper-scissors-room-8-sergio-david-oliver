Let's try to divide the problem into 3 portions so that we are able to work on seperate things:
Start with a common repo, everyone branches to work individually, we merge at the end.

1. Scoring and input variables - ollie
2. Logic - serge
3. Determine winner, replay? - david

1. Scoring and input variables Psuedocode:

-Create empty variables for score (player score and computer)
-Create first prompt for the user to select their move (either as multiple choice or typing out)
-Create an object with 3 options (rock, paper, scissors)

let array = [rock, paper, scissors]
            [0,     1,      2]
            Math.floor(Math.random(3))

-Once a random number has been generater, come up with a nested if statement that assigns the computer's move

2. Logic Pseudocode:

 We have 3 options to choose from: rock, paper, scissors

 rock beats scissors
 scissors beats paper
 paper beats rock

 set winningHand = false;


                    user win
                    user rock - comp scissors
                    user paper - comp rock
                    user scissors - comp paper


                                draw 
                                user rock - comp rock
                                user paper - comp paper
                                user scissors - comp scissors   // Don't need these options, as draw can be determined by user = comp


                                        user lose
                                        user rock - comp paper
                                        user paper - comp scissors
                                        user scissors - comp rock // With that logic probably don't need this either, as an "else" can probably cover it




if rock > scissors {winningHand = true}
if scissors > paper {winningHand = true}
if paper > rock {winningHand = true}


3. Determining winnner & next steps Pseudocode:

-What happens if user wins, draws, or loses
-If win, score++ and congratulations message
-If draw, no change to score, draw message
-If lose, computerScore++ and you lose message

-Options to play again?
-Confirm() returns true or false,
-If true, loop continues, score maintained
-If cancel, game stops, thanks for playing + "name", alert message of final score
